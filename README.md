# java-basics
Apparently, if you don't use it you lose it! So I'm going to start from the basics. Should go quick right?!? :-)

Working my way through Sam's Teach Yourself Java in 24 hours. I guess I'm the "Impatient intellectual who knows another programming language and wants to get up to speed quickly on Java". Close enough! ;-)
