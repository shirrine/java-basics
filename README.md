# java-basics
Apparently, if you don't use it you lose it! So I'm going to start from the basics. Should go quick right?!? :-)

Two weeks later... all done! I am the Java Master!!! Ok... not really... but I'm getting there. :-) On to more advanced topics and building cool things.

Thanks for watching! ;-)
